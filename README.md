# PASSWORD GENERATOR

# Description

The assignment was to create a functional password generator that prompts the user for input criteria and displays a randomized password. I first created functions that generate random characters. I then created window promps, alerts, and confirms to gather user date. I then assigned each of these to an array and created a for loop to generate a password.
